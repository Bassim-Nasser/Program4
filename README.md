Review#1
The app works just fine. I like the idea of the button for more info instead of tabs. However, the small font wasn't clear enough on the landing page. I would suggest that to change the size of it and make it a little bit bigger. The code is clean and I like how you order it.
By running the code on a tablet, the fonts are too small and need to be adjusted, as well as the button size. 
Overall, the app run smooth and there are no errors. Good work!
